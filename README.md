# Selenium Form Automation Testing

## Project Overview
This project automates the process of filling out and submitting a form using Selenium in Python. The form used for testing is hosted at [Bootstrap Template](https://mytestingthoughts.com). The automation script:

- Fills all required fields with test data
- Submits the form automatically
- Logs failures, errors, and the corresponding input data into a `.csv` file

The project follows the PEP8 coding standard and utilizes `black` or `flake8` for linting and formatting.
